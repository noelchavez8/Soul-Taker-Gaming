		<p><i>How do you get better at PvP? Well, it is me who wants to tell you how I get better. Let me take you step by step on how I do it.</i></p>
		<h2>1. Learn to click Faster than you can. 
		<p><b>I started with 4 clicks and it was not enough, I needed more power. I went to 5 then 6, 7 and now I can do an average of 8 clicks per second. This is good because in PVP you definately need this.</b></p>
		<h2>2. Strategy
		<p><b>In PVP you can not just walk up to the person if they have better gear right? Try to build up and drop on them or some strategy like troll them.
